# Electric field detector, contactless high voltage detector
## Electric-field FET-based detector, lights an LED when an E-field is near the tip.
This circuit is a simple electric field detector. It can can detect very faint electric fields present around powered electric lines.

The circuit should be used as a novelty or science experiment tool and not to infer if a line is safe to touch: in this latter case you are directed to more reliable professional tools.

Nothing really new: a JFET is used to sense the electric field generated by high voltage electric line; the JFET amplifies the signal very little, but it lowers the impedence and provide current to a level suitable for transistor amplification. The two transistor can be any low power NPN scavenged from anywhere. The two-transistor are configured as a sort of thresholded amplifier: when the voltage at R2 rises at above 3V circa, Q1 starts pumping current into the LED with a step curve providing a better go-no/go rensponse. The circuit is the same as the one used in the Korg Monotron to drive the LFO LED.

A low current LED could have been connected directly between V+ and the Drain of the JFET and removing TR1, TR2 and R3 through R7: in this case the LED would light up in a linear way, no threshold. See bottom of post for a description of what TR2 is there for.

Stray charge may escape from the tip of R1 for tip-effect letting the intrinsic capacitance at the gate of the JFET charge positively giving a positive read after a little while. So, a curled tip and a very high resistance path to ground in the form of a few turns of thin wire around resistor R1, help keep things in balance. In case, a very very high resistor can be connected between gate and ground (R8), but this will limit sensitivity very much.
Resistor R1 is there to provide a protection to the delicate gate of the JFET and the delicate heart of the operator in case of contact to a live line. Here, the higher the value of the resistor, the better. R1 also provides for the sensing tip.

Raising the value of R1 with the purpose of reducing sensitivity is useless though, because the gate eats almost no current so any voltage drop would require an unreasonably high value of R1.
It is worth trying any JFET one may have in his drawer: the 2N4416A if a very good one and I happen to have a few, but any other should do: donâ€™t be afraid of experimenting, success should come anyways. The connection to the case of the JFET, if present, should go to ground.

See the close-up with the detail around the gate of the JFET.
It is very important to note that the gate of the JFET is not soldered through the breadboard, rather it is bent above it and R1 soldered directly to the flying gate! This is necessary as solder paste or even poor PCB might provide to low a path to its Source or, even worse, its Drain.
Also, to be on the safe side, before soldering the JFET I short circuited all of its leads with a very thin wire, a few turns to prevent any excess voltage difference between gate and any other pin. Don forget to remove it when finished soldering, though!

From time to time charge might accumulate at the gate keeping the LED always on: just touch the negative of the circuit and  touch and let go the sensing tip.
